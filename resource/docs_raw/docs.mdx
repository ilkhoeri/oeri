Welcome to **Oeri UI** ‚Äî where control stays in your hands.

**Oeri UI** is a modular React component system built with a simple but powerful idea:

> You deserve full control over your UI without fighting against the library itself.

Whether you're building prototypes, SaaS platforms, or enterprise applications, **Oeri UI** gives you flexible, scalable, production-ready components, hooks, and utilities ‚Äî all written in clean TypeScript and styled with TailwindCSS.

No lock-ins. No hidden traps. Just your code, your rules, your creativity.

**Oeri UI** combines:

- ‚ö° **Production-ready components** with built-in animation and accessibility
- üß© **Flexible hooks and utilities** to enhance React app logic
- üé® **Design system integration** powered by Tailwind utility-first styling
- üõ†Ô∏è **Developer-first tooling**: strong TypeScript support, configuration simplicity, and modular architecture

Use **Oeri UI** to speed up your development, stay consistent, and scale your projects with confidence ‚Äî from prototypes to enterprise-grade apps.

<br />

## Philosophy![brain](/images/fluent-emoji-icons.svg#brain)

---

> **Control every lock-in.** Keep the power, not the package.
> Oeri UI lets you own your components ‚Äî not just use them.

At the heart of **Oeri UI** is a simple but radical philosophy:
Most UI libraries prioritize their internal structure over your freedom.
They bundle opinions, add magic behaviors, and leave you wrestling with hidden constraints whenever you need something beyond the default.

**Oeri UI** reverses this relationship.

- **Full Ownership**: <br /> You have total control over `behavior`, `styles`, and `structure`. **Oeri UI** provides the foundation ‚Äî the rest is yours to shape.

- **Minimal Lock-in**: <br /> Every component, hook, and utility is designed to be self-contained and easily replaceable.

- **Adaptability First**: <br /> Whether it's nested dialogs, mobile-specific behaviors, or animation fine-tuning, **Oeri UI** gives you the primitives to adapt, not dictate.

- **Real-World Driven**: <br /> Built from experience facing real-world frustrations ‚Äî unnecessary complexity, bloated dependencies, waiting on library updates ‚Äî Oeri UI solves the problems developers actually encounter.

- **Efficient, Not Excessive**: <br /> Install only what you need. Use only what you want. Avoid runtime bloat from unused code.

**In short**: <br />
**Oeri UI** is here so you can stop bending your project around someone else‚Äôs idea of **`‚Äúgood enough‚Äù`** ‚Äî and start building exactly what you envision.

<br />

## Manifesto![fire](/images/fluent-emoji-icons.svg#fire)

---

We believe that **developer experience is productivity**.
**Oeri UI** was born out of real-world needs: building interfaces that are flexible, lightweight, and fully in your control.

Here are the principles we stand by:

- **üîß Control Every Lock-In**
  No feature is a black box. Every part of Oeri UI can be extended, replaced, or restructured to fit your project‚Äôs architecture ‚Äî without compromise.

- **üß± Headless by Philosophy, Opinionated by Choice**
  We embrace headless logic. But when it saves time, we offer sensible defaults ‚Äî so you can move fast and still fine-tune easily.

- **üì¶ Import Only What You Need**
  Oeri UI is built to be modular. No bulky bundles, no hidden dependencies. When you import a single component, that‚Äôs all you get ‚Äî clean and efficient.

- **‚ö° Real-World First**
  Every utility, hook, and component solves problems we‚Äôve faced in production: nested dialogs, mobile query support, responsive sheets, reusable patterns ‚Äî all baked in.

- **üöÄ Developer-First, Always**
  Built with TypeScript from day one. Integrated with Tailwind, Vite, Next.js, and the modern stack. Everything is designed to help you build faster, smarter, and with confidence.

Oeri UI is about **freedom** ‚Äî the freedom to build on your own terms.
You‚Äôre the architect of your app. We‚Äôre just here to give you the best tools.

## Quick Installation![quick-installation](/images/fluent-emoji-icons.svg#hight-voltage)

---

Get up and running in just a few steps:

### 1. Create a New React Project

You can use npx CLI to install the React library framework. The npx ships with npm.

This lets you install packages and run commands in one step. You can use the following command to start creating a new project.

Already have a project? You can skip this step.

<div className="mt-8 grid xl:grid-cols-1">
  <div className="relative overflow-hidden rounded-xl border border-muted bg-muted/40 backdrop-blur shadow-md">
    <div className="relative z-10 flex flex-col gap-4">
      <div className="mb-4 flex flex-col font-mono last:mb-0">
        <div className="flex flex-row items-center justify-start gap-3 border-b bg-background-box px-3">
          <div className="flex h-10 select-none items-center gap-2 truncate font-medium text-muted-foreground font-geist-mono">
            <Svg className="mt-0.5 size-[18px] text-constructive">
              <path d="m6.34,4.37h-1.98c-1.31,0-2.37,1.06-2.37,2.37v10.53c0,1.31,1.06,2.37,2.37,2.37h1.98m11.31,0h1.98c1.31,0,2.37-1.06,2.37-2.37V6.73c0-1.31-1.06-2.37-2.37-2.37h-1.98" />
              <path d="m6.52,7.5l3.91,3.91-3.91,3.91" />
              <path d="m12,16.5h5.48" />
            </Svg>
            <span className="font-geist-mono">Terminal</span>
          </div>
        </div>
        <div className="relative flex flex-col rtl:items-end overflow-x-auto whitespace-nowrap rounded-b-md border border-transparent bg-background py-6 pl-4 pr-2 leading-[19px] text-color webkit-scrollbar">
          <div dir="ltr" className="relative box-border flex w-max flex-row items-center overflow-hidden whitespace-pre text-nowrap border-none bg-transparent leading-normal text-color">
            <span className="text-muted-foreground font-geist-mono">-&nbsp;</span>
            <span className="text-[#e34ba9] font-geist-mono">npx&nbsp;</span>
            <TypingWords el="span" withCursor className="[display:flex] font-geist-mono" placeholders={["create-react-app@latest", "create-next-app@latest", "gatsby new my-project", "create-remix@latest", "create-vite@latest"]} />
          </div>
        </div>
      </div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

> **Note**: npx requires npm version 5.2 or later. If you‚Äôve installed the latest versions of Node and npm, you should also have npx. Otherwise, you should upgrade Node and/or npm.

### 2. Install essential utilities

Add some [`tailwindcss`](https://tailwindcss.com) class utilities like [`tailwind-merge`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/tailwind-merge) and [`tailwindcss-animate`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/tailwindcss-animate).

```bash
npm install xuxi@latest && npm install tailwindcss tailwind-merge tailwindcss-animate -D
```

> **Note**: Oeri UI relies on TailwindCSS utilities. Make sure Tailwind is properly configured in your project.

- **References:**
  - [xuxi](https://ilkhoeri.github.io/xuxi/)
  - [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/installation)
  - [Tailwind Merge](https://www.npmjs.com/package/tailwind-merge)
  - [Tailwind CSS Animate](https://www.npmjs.com/package/tailwindcss-animate)

Once the installation completes, run your project to start editing and using the oeri module utilities.

### 3. Use Oeri UI Components

You can copy components directly from the docs, or import them from your own internal module (especially in monorepo or bundled setups).

```tsx
import { Button } from "@/ui/button";
```

Everything is tree-shakable and modular ‚Äî only the components you use will be included in the final bundle.

## TypeScript First![typeScript](/images/icons.svg#typescript)

---

**Oeri UI** is developed with **TypeScript** at its core.
Type safety, better IntelliSense, and powerful autocompletion are all included ‚Äî giving you a smoother, faster development experience.

<br />

## Why Oeri UI?![why-oeri](/images/fluent-emoji-icons.svg#bulb)

---

**Oeri UI** isn‚Äôt just a UI kit. It‚Äôs a mindset ‚Äî designed for developers who want to build fast, flexible, and fully controlled interfaces.

Here‚Äôs why developers choose Oeri UI:

- **üß© Modular, Not Monolithic**
  Use only what you need. Each component, hook, and utility is standalone ‚Äî no bloated bundles, no forced dependencies.

- **üõ†Ô∏è Fully Customizable Components**
  Every component is designed to be reshaped, restyled, and rebuilt to suit your project‚Äôs unique architecture ‚Äî even for deeply nested or mobile-first use cases.

- **üåê Real Use-Case Coverage**
  Features like nested dialogs, dynamic sheet behavior, indeterminate checkboxes, scroll state tracking, and rating fractions ‚Äî all based on practical needs, not just demo aesthetics.

- **‚öôÔ∏è Developer-Centric Hooks**
  Hooks like `useOpenState`, `useWindowScroll`, and `useReload` abstract common logic into simple, reusable building blocks.

- **üéõ Interactive Configuration, Instantly**
  Our docs come with real-time configurators. Adjust props, preview results, and copy the code instantly ‚Äî no guesswork.

- **‚ö° TypeScript First, Tailwind Native**
  Built from the ground up with strong typing and utility-first styling. You get precise IntelliSense, autocompletion, and fast iteration.

- **üßò No Lock-In, No Waiting**
  You don‚Äôt have to wait for pull requests or adapt to someone else‚Äôs constraints. You‚Äôre in charge ‚Äî of the code, the behavior, and the roadmap.

<br />

## Comparison![comparison](/images/fluent-emoji-icons.svg#vs)

---

There are many excellent UI libraries out there ‚Äî and each has its strengths.
Oeri UI is built for developers who want **fine-grained control**, **zero lock-in**, and **practical flexibility** at every level.

| **Feature / Philosophy**     | **Oeri UI**                            | [**shadcn/ui**](https://ui.shadcn.com/) | **Other UI Kits**            |
| ---------------------------- | -------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------- | ---------------------------- |
| **Component Architecture**   | Fully modular & headless-ready         | Based on Radix UI (headless)            | Often pre-styled & fixed     |
| **Customization Level**      | Full override, no constraints          | Themeable via Tailwind                  | Limited/custom-theme support |
| **Nested Component Support** | Built-in for dialogs, sheets, etc.     | Manual workarounds often needed         | Frequently unsupported       |
| **Bundle Size Control**      | Import only what you use               | Depends on implementation               | Often bundled                |
| **Utility Hooks**            | Included (scroll, open state, etc.)    | Not provided                            | Usually external             |
| **Runtime Behavior**         | Optimized for nested/mobile edge cases | May require patching or fork            | Varies widely                |
| **Framework Agnostic**       | Yes (React-focused, framework-free)    | Yes                                     | Often tied to specific stack |
| **Interactive Docs**         | Live demos with real-time config       | Partial                                 | Rare                         |
| **DX Focus**                 | Built from real-world usage            | Community-driven                        | Company/branding-driven      |

> üß† **Note**: <br /> Oeri UI and shadcn/ui can even complement each other ‚Äî both are headless-first and Tailwind-native.
> But if you need more **out-of-the-box control**, or you're building for **edge cases and deeply custom interfaces**, Oeri UI may fit better.

<br />

## Principles & Best Practices

Oeri UI is built not only to help you move faster ‚Äî but also to help you move better.
Here are the core principles and practices we encourage when using Oeri UI across your projects:

---

### **1. Clarity Over Complexity**

Every component and hook is designed to be readable, predictable, and understandable.
Favor simplicity and transparency over cleverness or over-abstraction.

> ‚úÖ Tip: Prefer declarative patterns. Use configuration props to express intent.

---

### **2. Maximum Control, Minimal Lock-in**

Oeri UI offers complete flexibility. You're encouraged to adjust, extend, or replace components freely ‚Äî without fighting the framework.

> üõ†Ô∏è Components are headless-first and fully typed, with props exposed for total customization.

---

### **3. Design with Composition**

Think in composable layers. Use primitives like `Dialog`, `Sheet`, or `Dropdown` to build your own UI logic ‚Äî then reuse them across your app.

> üß© Grouped components (`Avatar.Group`, `Checker.Group`, etc.) let you express UI relationships clearly.

---

### **4. Accessibility Matters**

Oeri UI builds on top of a11y-compliant foundations. When extending components, make sure to maintain focus management, keyboard support, and semantic markup.

> ‚ôø Always test with keyboard navigation and screen readers when relevant.

---

### **5. Lean by Default**

Only import what you need. Oeri UI is not a bundle ‚Äî it‚Äôs a toolbox.
Use one utility or component without dragging the rest.

> üöÄ This helps keep your pages lightweight and performance-friendly.

---

### **6. TypeScript is Your Friend**

Leverage the full power of TypeScript: autocompletion, prop inference, and error checking are all first-class citizens in Oeri UI.

> üß† Prefer strong types for better maintainability and onboarding.

---

### **7. Embrace the Tailwind Mentality**

Oeri UI does not fight Tailwind ‚Äî it flows with it.
Write styles declaratively, override easily, and theme using your design tokens.

> üé® Use `tailwind-merge` and utility classes to layer your design system precisely.

---

By following these principles, you‚Äôll not only write better UIs ‚Äî you'll also build more consistent, maintainable, and joyful experiences for your users and your team.

---

## Start Building![build](/images/fluent-emoji-icons.svg#building-construction)

Head over to the [components](./docs/web/components), [hooks](./docs/web/hooks), or [utilities](./docs/web/utilities) section to begin building your interface, your way.

‚ú® You‚Äôre in full control ‚Äî that‚Äôs the Oeri way.

---

> **üí° Tip**: <br /> Use the interactive configurators provided in the docs to customize each component instantly!

<br />

## What‚Äôs Next

---

You‚Äôre ready to start building.

Here‚Äôs where to go from here:

- üîß **Explore Components**
  Dive into pre-built, flexible UI components ‚Äî each with live demos and interactive configurators.
  ‚Üí [View Components](/docs/web/components)

- ‚öôÔ∏è **Use Custom Hooks**
  Take control of app logic with reusable, thoughtful abstractions like `useOpenState`, `useReload`, and more.
  ‚Üí [View Hooks](/docs/web/hooks)

- üõ† **Leverage Utilities**
  Streamline your workflow with utilities like `cn()`, `match()`, and `isBrowser()`.
  ‚Üí [View Utilities](/docs/web/utilities)

- üéØ **Configure & Extend**
  Fine-tune behavior, animations, responsiveness, and component states.
  ‚Üí [View Configuration](/docs/web/configuration)

Oeri UI was built to stay out of your way and let you build _your_ way.
The docs are designed to be practical, minimal, and actionable ‚Äî just like the library.

---

> Prefer exploring visually?
> Most components have demo variants and real-world usage examples to guide you.

<br />

## Do & Don't![do-and-dont](/images/fluent-emoji-icons.svg#horizontal-traffic-light)

---

Some simple practices to get the most out of Oeri UI ‚Äî and avoid common mistakes.

<Typography el="div" prose="h2" className="mt-6">
  ‚úÖ Do
</Typography>

- **Use Tailwind as your design engine**
  Oeri UI is designed to play well with utility-first CSS. Extend freely with Tailwind classes.

- **Leverage interactive configurators**
  Most components come with built-in configurators in the docs. Use them to explore variants quickly.

- **Keep components lean and composable**
  Reuse `Group`, `Item`, and `Root` structures to build scalable UI blocks.

- **Use provided hooks for consistent state behavior**
  Hooks like `useOpenState` or `useReload` solve real-world needs across many components.

- **Customize deeply when needed**
  You have full control. Don‚Äôt hesitate to override behavior, UI, or structure when it fits your use case.

- **Use TypeScript for a smoother dev experience**
  Every piece is strongly typed. Embrace type safety and take advantage of IDE autocompletion.

---

<Typography el="div" prose="h2">
  üö´ Don‚Äôt
</Typography>

- **Don‚Äôt treat Oeri UI as a theme-only system**
  It‚Äôs not just about looks. Most components encapsulate logic, accessibility, and interactivity.

- **Avoid bloated imports**
  Only import what you use. The system is modular ‚Äî take just what you need, and leave the rest.

- **Don‚Äôt ignore `variants`, `slots`, or `props` flexibility**
  These are key tools for adjusting behavior without rewriting or duplicating code.

- **Don‚Äôt force it into non-React contexts**
  Oeri UI is React-specific ‚Äî it‚Äôs not meant for other frameworks (yet).

- **Don‚Äôt forget accessibility**
  Oeri UI aims for accessible defaults. Don‚Äôt strip out roles, labels, or keyboard handlers unless you know what you're doing.

> Think of Oeri UI as a design system _framework_, not just a component library ‚Äî it grows with your project.
