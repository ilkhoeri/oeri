### API References

- [`mdn`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/SVG/Element/svg)

The Svg element is a container that defines a new coordinate system and viewport. It is used as the outermost element of SVG documents, but it can also be used to embed an SVG fragment inside an SVG or HTML document with added some utility properties.

Svg will be very useful for you when you want to use a more specific `<LogoIcon/>` in an application.

We added several utility properties to make it easier for you in development, such as size ratio, fill property adjustment, stroke and several others.

### API

| API            | Type                                | default     | Annotation                                       |
| -------------- | ----------------------------------- | ----------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| size`?`        | Sizes                               | `16px`      | `size={18}` `size="18px"` `size="sm"`            |
| h`?`           | string number                       | `height`    | abbreviated `height` attribute name              |
| w`?`           | string number                       | `width`     | abbreviated `width` attribute name               |
| ratio`?`       | \{h?: number; w?: number\}          | `undefined` | scaling height and width when determining `size` |
| currentFill`?` | "stroke" \| "fill" \| "fill-stroke" | `stroke`    | adjust currentColor on the coordinate            |


### Sizing Ratio


By default, the `viewbox="0 0 24 24"` and `size={16}`, here is an example of changing the viewbox and ratio of `w` \(width\)

When `<svg/>` has a different viewbox size, you should pass the viewbox size back to the element, like `viewBox="0 0 94.2 24"`, and to preserve the `size` property you can calculate the ratio by adding `ratio={{ w: 3.925 /* 94.2/24 */ }}`, which means when `size={16}`, then by defaults to `height={16}` and `width={62.8}`. So it will look like this:

```tsx
function LogoIcon({ viewBox = "0 0 94.2 24", ...props }: SvgProps) {
  return (
   <Svg currentFill="fill" ratio={{ w: 3.925 }} {...{viewBox, ...props}}>
      {/* child */}
    </Svg>
  );
}
```
