### rem dan em

rem and em functions are converters for changing values ​​in various formats into values ​​with rem or em units.

#### Syntax

```ts
const rem: (value: unknown) => string;
const em: (value: unknown) => string;
```

#### Parameters

`value` (unknown): The value to convert. Can be a number, string, or supported expression (e.g. `calc`, `clamp`).

**Returns:**

- A string containing a value in rem or em units.

#### Details

1. If the input is a number, the function divides it by 16 to convert from pixels (px) to rem/em.
2. Strings that already have the same units are returned directly unchanged.
3. Supports complex strings such as calc, clamp, or a space- or comma-separated list of values.

#### Example of Usage

```ts
rem(16);
// Output: "1rem"

em("32px");
// Output: "2em"

rem("calc(100% - 10px)");
// Output: "calc(100% - 0.625rem)"
```

### px

The px function is used to convert a value to pixels or get a numeric value from a string in pixels, rems, or ems.

#### Syntax

```ts
function px(value: unknown): string | number;
```

#### Parameters

`value` (unknown): The value to convert. Can be a number or a string.

**Returns:**

- If value is a number, it is returned directly.
- If value is a string:
  If it contains px units, it is returned as a unitless number.
  If it contains rem or em units, it is converted to pixels assuming 1 rem/em = 16 pixels.
  If it contains an expression such as calc or var, it is returned as a string.

#### Example of Usage

```ts
px(16);
// Output: 16

px("1rem");
// Output: 16

px("2em");
// Output: 32

px("calc(100% - 10px)");
// Output: "calc(100% - 10px)"
```

### createConverter

This function is a utility to create a custom converter with specific units. For example, rem and em are created using this function.

#### Syntax

```ts
function createConverter(units: string, { shouldScale }?: { shouldScale?: boolean }): (value: unknown) => string;
```

#### Parameters

1. `units` (string): The units used by the converter (e.g. `rem`, `em`).
2. `options` (object) (optional):
   `shouldScale` (boolean): Specifies whether the conversion result should be scaled using the scaleRem function.
3. Returns: A converter function that accepts a value to convert to the specified units.

#### Example of Usage:

```ts
const pt = createConverter("pt");
pt(16);
// Output: "1pt"
```

### Advantages and Optimizations

1. `Flexible`: Supports various input formats such as numbers, strings, and complex expressions.
2. `High Compatibility`: Can be used for various unit conversion needs in CSS, including responsive units such as rem and em.
3. `Advanced Expressions`: Supports operations with calc, clamp, and other CSS functions.
4. `Scalability`: The createConverter function allows the creation of custom converters for other units in the future.
