## Usage

A basic example to quickly demonstrate how the `Command` component works.
This will showcase the essential functionality of the command interface in a simple, usable format.

## Properties

Interactive configurator to explore different customization options for the `Command` component.
This section allows users to adjust properties such as state control, error handling, and other configurable aspects of the `Command` component.

**Note:**

- `!modal`:
  A special flag often used to force display of a component within the DOM structure.
  This is typically used when combined with the forceOpened prop to ensure that the command interface stays open in certain conditions.

- `forceOpened`:
  A prop primarily used during the development process to control whether the command is forced to remain open.
  This prop can be very useful for testing or ensuring that specific elements stay visible during interactions.

## Data Types

Defines the structure of the data used by the `Command` component.
The `Command` component can handle both static and dynamic data, depending on whether you choose to define data using `props.actions` or manually specifying the children components.

- Important:

  - Either props.actions or children should be specified; you cannot use both at the same time or omit both.
  - Using both options simultaneously will cause confusion in the function and omitting both will result in no action being executed.
  - To prevent this conflict, error handling is implemented to ensure that only one data type (either props.actions or children) is used.

- Alternative Approach:

  - You can use the `<Command.Root>` compound component to group multiple` <Command>` components together while managing their data types effectively.

### Data Single

Demonstrates how to define a single data item for the `Command` component.
Ideal for situations where you need to display a simple, single-action command with minimal configuration.

### Data Group

Shows how to define a group of data for the `Command` component.
This allows multiple actions or commands to be grouped together, useful for when you want to provide several related options in a single command interface.

## Multiple Command

When using the `Command` component in multiple places or contexts with different states, itâ€™s essential to create separate store and storeState instances using the `createCommand()` function.
This ensures that each command operates independently and does not interfere with others.
