## Usage

<ButtonDemosUsage />

## Properties

<ButtonDemosConfigurator />

## UnstyledButton

UnstyledButton allows to provide its own style independent of all the styles and variant properties of `Button`.
This can be very useful when you want to use it as a trigger for a tooltip or another toggle.

Used as `asChild` it helps to pass the button property to its single child.
