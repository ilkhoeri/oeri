`Sheets` is a flexible and composable UI abstraction that unifies multiple interaction patterns — including Accordion, Collapsible, Dialog, Drawer, and Dropdown — into a single, consistent system.
Designed to simplify complex layouts and improve development efficiency, `Sheets` enables you to manage visibility, transitions, and nested structures seamlessly across different UI contexts.

It offers variants suited for various use cases, such as content organization (Accordion), simple toggling (Collapsible), modal workflows (Dialog), off-canvas navigation (Drawer), and compact selection lists (Dropdown).
With `Sheets`, you can build modular, accessible, and highly customizable user experiences with minimal boilerplate.

## Usages

Various examples of `Sheets` Implementation for various component patterns.
`Sheets` offers a high moment to create interactive components that can be developed as needed.

### Sheets Variant Accordion

Display collapsible content organized into accordion-style sections.
This variant allows expanding one section at a time for a clean and structured user experience.

## Animation

The [`accordion`](/docs/components/web/sheets#sheets-accordion) and [`collapsible`](/docs/components/web/sheets#sheets-collapsible) variant components use keyframe animation which by default is set using the tailwindcss class.

Add the following [`animation`](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/animation#customizing-your-theme) to your [`tailwind.config.js`](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/configuration) file:

```ts
import { PluginAPI, type Config } from "tailwindcss/types/config";
import plugin from "tailwindcss/plugin";

export default {
  theme: {
    extend: {
      animation: {
        "collapse-open": "collapse-open 0.2s linear forwards",
        "collapse-closed": "collapse-closed 0.2s linear forwards"
      },
      keyframes: {
        "collapse-open": {
          from: { height: "0", opacity: "0" },
          to: { height: "var(--measure-available-h)" }
        },
        "collapse-closed": {
          from: { height: "var(--measure-available-h)" },
          "85%": { opacity: "0" },
          to: { height: "0", visibility: "hidden" }
        }
      }
    }
  },
  plugins: [
    require("tailwindcss-animate"),
    plugin(({ addBase, addUtilities }: PluginAPI) => {
      addBase({});
      addUtilities({});
    })
  ]
} satisfies Config;
```
