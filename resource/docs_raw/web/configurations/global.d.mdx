## Declare Type

Utility types for object transformation, key manipulation, and type inference in TypeScript

### nullable

```ts
type nullable = null | undefined;
```

Represents values that can be either `null` or `undefined`.

---

### falsy

- [`learn`](https://www.learn-ts.org/en/Truthy_and_Falsy)

```ts
type falsy = false | 0 | "" | null | undefined | (number & { __falsyNaN__: void });
```

In TypeScript, as in JavaScript, a _"falsy"_ value is a value that is treated as false when encountered in a Boolean context, such as in an if statement or when using the logical NOT operator `(!)`. There are six falsy values in TypeScript:

- `false`: The boolean value false.
- `0`: The number zero.
- `""` (empty string): An empty string.
- `null`: Represents the absence of a value.
- `undefined`: Indicates that a variable has not been assigned a value.
- `NaN`: "Not a Number," often resulting from invalid mathematical operations (represented using a branded intersection type because TypeScript does not support `NaN` as a literal type).

All other values in TypeScript are considered _"truthy,"_ meaning they evaluate to true in a Boolean context. This includes:

- Any number other than 0, including negative numbers.
- Non-empty strings.
- Arrays (even empty arrays []).
- Objects (even empty objects {}).
- Functions.

**Note:** This type is primarily for static type checking and should be used with caution if exact runtime validation of `NaN` is needed.

---

### RequiredKeys

```ts
type RequiredKeys<T> = T extends string ? T | `${T}.required` : never;
```

Expands a string type to include a `.required` suffix, indicating a key that is required.

---

### SplitKey

```ts
type SplitKey<K> = K extends `${infer Key}.required` ? { key: Key; required: true } : { key: K; required: false };
```

Splits a string key into its base key and a `required` flag. If the key ends in `.required`, the flag is set to `true`.

---

### ExtractParsedKey

```ts
type ExtractParsedKey<T, K extends string, IsRequired extends boolean> = {
  [P in K]: SplitKey<P> extends infer R ? (R extends { key: infer K2; required: infer R2 } ? (K2 extends keyof T ? (R2 extends IsRequired ? K2 : never) : never) : never) : never;
}[K];
```

Extracts the keys from type `T` that match the parsed key format and are either required or optional, depending on `IsRequired`.

---

### ParsedKeyUnion

```ts
type ParsedKeyUnion<K extends string> = { [P in K]: SplitKey<P>["key"] }[K];
```

Maps a union of keys with optional `.required` suffixes to their base key strings.

---

### Join

```ts
type Join<K, P> = K extends string ? (P extends string ? `${K}.${P}` : never) : never;
```

Joins two strings into a dot-separated path, useful for generating deep key paths.

---

### Prev

```ts
type Prev = [never, 0, 1, 2, ..., 21];
```

Provides an array-based utility to calculate the previous number. Often used to limit recursion depth in utility types.

---

### IgnoringSuffix

```ts
type IgnoringSuffix<T> = Date | string[] | number[] | Array<T>;
```

Defines types that should stop recursion when resolving deep paths.

---

### DeepValueType

```ts
type DeepValueType<T, P extends string> = ...
```

Resolves the type of a deeply nested property from object `T` using a dot-separated string path `P`.

---

### Booleanish

```ts
type Booleanish = boolean | "true" | "false";
```

Represents values that are either `boolean` or their string equivalents.

---

### Direction

```ts
type Direction = "ltr" | "rtl";
```

Defines text directionality, either left-to-right or right-to-left.

---

### InferType

```ts
type InferType<T> = T extends (...args: any[]) => infer R ? R : never;
```

Infers the return type of a function type.

---

### DeepPaths

```ts
type DeepPaths<T, Prev extends string = ""> = ...
```

Recursively computes all possible deep paths in a nested object type `T`, returning them as dot-separated strings. Stops at arrays.

---

### Paths

```ts
type Paths<T, D extends number = 4> = ...
```

Computes dot-separated paths to all nested properties within object `T`, up to a maximum depth `D`. Stops when it reaches types defined in `IgnoringSuffix`.

---

### Merge

```ts
type Merge<T> = { [K in keyof T]: T[K] };
```

Creates a new type by shallow-merging all properties of `T`. Useful for resolving type intersections.

---

### Nullable

```ts
type Nullable<T, K extends RequiredKeys<keyof T> | void = never, N extends nullable = null> = ...
```

Makes properties of `T` nullable. You can control which keys are required/optional using the `K` generic, and customize the nullable type via `N`.

---

### Except

```ts
type Except<T, K extends keyof T> = { [P in Exclude<keyof T, K>]: T[P] };
```

Creates a type by omitting the specified keys `K` from type `T`.

---

### NonNullables

```ts
type NonNullables<T> = {
  [K in keyof Required<T>]: NonNullable<T[K]>;
};
```

Ensures all properties in `T` are required and non-nullable.

---

### NonNullableConstructor

```ts
type NonNullableConstructor<T, N = never> = ...
```

Recursively makes all fields non-nullable. Special handling for arrays, functions, and dates.

---

### KeysConstructor

```ts
type KeysConstructor<U extends [string, unknown]> = ...
```

Generates a union of string templates in the format `"key-subkey"` where `key` is from a tupleâ€™s first element and `subkey` is each string key of the second element.

---

### export `{}`

Required to ensure that the TypeScript file is treated as a module and applies the `declare global` block properly.
